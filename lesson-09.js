// This lesson works with two provided files: open `lesson-09.html` with Live Server and keep
// the DevTools Console open, and write all JavaScript in `lesson-09.js`, which the page
// already loads with `defer`. The questions wait as comments in the JavaScript file.

// TODO: Part one.
// Log one sentence to the console, then log `document.title`, and confirm that both appear in
// the DevTools Console rather than in a terminal. In a comment, state what the `defer`
// attribute prevented.

//defer ensures the script doesn't reach for elements that don't exist yet, it defers the running of the script until the elements exist.
// TODO: Part two.
// Select the page's `h1` with `querySelector` and replace its `textContent` with a label name
// of your choosing. Select the tagline by its class and change its text, then add the provided
// highlight class to it through `classList`.

// carries the cards class. Reload the page and confirm that five cards stand on it.

// truthy, push a new artist object built from it into the array and append one new card for
// it, reusing your card-building code from part three, ideally as a function that both parts
// call. An empty submission does nothing; name in a comment which falsy value makes that check
// work. As a stretch, clear the input by assigning it an empty string after each successful
// addition.
